About Me

> Hey! I’m Jesper, a 28-year-old aspiring JavaScript developer based in Kristinehamn, Värmland.
I’m currently studying full-stack web development, diving deep into modern web technologies.
When I’m not coding, I’m training Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, running, or spending time with my two kids.
I love building clean, functional, user-friendly apps—and I’m always hungry to learn more.
